## 👋 Hi, my name is Jamie. 

### 👀 I’m interested in Unity(2D), Spring Java, React, node.js, and your open source code. 

### 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and data science as well as how to only eat white parts for oreos.

### 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Making an awesome games! (Prefer 2D because I get motionsickness when I play in 3D, unless you wanna call 911 while testing our game.)

### 📫 How to reach me binyoon99@gmail.com or Discord Bin#0314 or just yell JAMIE YOON really loudly in your room and I'll come.
