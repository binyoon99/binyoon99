## 👋 Hi, my name is Jamie. 

### 👀 I’m interested in Unity(2D), Spring Java, React, node.js, and your open source code. 
### My main interest is Java, and C#. I'm currently doing a mobile app development using Kotlin instead of java with Android Studio Bumblebee 

### 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and data science as well as how to only eat white part of the oreo.

### 📫 How to reach me binyoon99@gmail.com or Discord Bin#0314 or just yell JAMIE YOON really loudly in your room and I'll come.
